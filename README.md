Common Federation AM API

This is the github repository used for collaborating on the Common Federation AM API.

The idea:
- Changes to federation-am-api.adoc are automatically applied to the document at the official site: TODO add link
- Github is used for discussing (create issue) and proposing changes (pull requests)
- Once there is concensus on an issue, the attached pull request(s) gets merged with the master

So the typical workflow is:
- Locally checkout the repository from github
- Make a branch
- Make your proposed changes
- Push the branch to github
- Create a "pull request" (= an issue with an attached branch to merge) on github, explaining what the change is, and why it is needed
- Discussion follows, in the created issue
- At one point, there is concensus
- The branch gets merged into the master
- The document at the official site automatically gets updated
